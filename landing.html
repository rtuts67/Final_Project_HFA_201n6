  <h1> North Seattle</h1>

  <div id="words"/>
  <p>Home to many neighborhoods North Seattle includes Northgate, Ravenna, Greenwood and many more options for you to choose a home. This includes plenty of shopping near U Village and NorthGate Mall along with many public libraries. School districts included are the North Cluster of the Seattle school district. You could go golfing at the Jackson Park Golf Club. You could pick one of the many parks and hit up the swing sets or grassy knolls. You’re going to want to pop into holes-in-the-wall like Jebena Café, BurgerMaster, Gyro Hut, Bark! Espresso, or Boud’s Pinehurst Pub. Finally, book a spa day at one of the many salons—there are even some for dogs, too!  There’s the Greenwood Car Show every June, and the beloved Seafair parade in August—complete with the Seafair Pirates and a synchronized motorcycle routine by the local police force. Monthly art walks showcase not only local artists, but give you a chance to tour all of the interesting businesses along Greenwood Avenue. The Taproot Theatre is still going strong despite being damaged in a fire in 2009.

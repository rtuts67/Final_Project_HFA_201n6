<p>cool stuff about north seattle.That's what I'm here for. I'm an actually smart person with real expertise in an academic field and I'm telling you that you're stupid. Your whole identity is a lie, and while you already know this at some level, which is of course the real impetus behind posting sarcastically on the internet among people you don't respect, the ego is not so easily broken. Your condition is the white male petty-bourgeois experience under decaying neoliberalism and it is only harming you. You will never be Einstein or Marx but most people are capable of being of moderate intelligence given enough humility and self-awareness. I'm doing this for your own good. Until you realize that you are not actually smart you will never succeed at being mediocre and will instead remain in a state of delusion, self-hatred, and isolation from the truth all around you. You will realize this eventually, but if you realize it now instead of at your lowest point you may yet be saved. Again, I am doing this for your own good please treat it seriously.

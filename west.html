    <p>Home to many neighborhoods, the west part of Seattle includes Ballard, Queen Anne, Interbay, Magnolia, Green Lake and many more options for you to choose a home (not to confuse with West Seattle which is more south). Ballard contains mainy local shops, antique stores, and breweries along with many parks. Ballard is one of the top rated high schools in the Seattle District. You can have a picnic at Discovery Park in Magnolia. You can also buy fresh organic food at Ballard's Farmers Market every Sunday. You can also go golfing at Interbay Golfcourse. You can go to breweries such as Holy Mountain in Magnolia as well.

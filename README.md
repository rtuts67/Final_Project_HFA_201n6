Problem Domain:

To provide a website that helps prospective home-buyers in the Seattle area have a little more knowledge of what is available, average list price, average sale price, size, days marketed, how much over asking price certain neighborhoods are, and a little bit of information about each neighborhood. Seattle is notorious for making it difficult for a first time home buyer or someone new to the area unfamiliar with how the market works. With multiple offers per property, and houses going $100,000 over asking, home buyers don’t have a clue where to begin. Many realtors and lenders are misleading, and don’t always provide clear cut advice. Sometimes, people want a visual of what is available… Redfin and Zillow do not explicitly tell you how much you need to bid, or even a ball park over the list price, so many people find themselves bidding too high.

The main target market for the purpose of the website will be middle to upper middle class families (couples, fam size of 1-4, retirees) or in other words an average sized family.

Our data will be pulled from Redfin. Our income brackets will be broken up into 3 groups: $65,000-$150,000, $150,001-$250,000, and $250,001-$400,000.

Our main areas of focus regarding property data will be:

Condo and House (maxed at $700k)

Our regions we will focus on:

North, South, East, and West Seattle

Project Outline:

Index.html/ Login Page - Will contain a form/filed for user input to include Email and Password
Index.html will contain some information about Seattle and a few pictures.
Index.html will also contain a link to Guide.html

Guide.html will have a form with a dropdown button that will ask the user annual household income bracket
There will be 3 options: These are listed above
Based on the input, a table will be rendered for the appropriate income brackets
(see sketch) - data will come from redfin list price for condo and house, SF

The user will pick a region, click, and each one will have its own landing page



A link back to index.html will be included on each page
